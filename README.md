# R-boot-camp
This self-guided data clinic intends to introduce graduate students to the use of R programming language and its important applications in disease ecology research. It will also provide basic tools to perform data exploration and analyses using R. No previous experience with R or similar statistical software is required (weâ€™ll start with the basics!), and at the end of the clinic participants will have the necessary tools to explore and use additional R learning tools (online courses, books, blogs).
